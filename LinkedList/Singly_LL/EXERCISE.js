2. **Question 2:**
   - Compare and contrast the efficiency of inserting a node at the beginning of a singly linked list with inserting a node at the end.
   - Discuss scenarios where inserting at the beginning might be preferred over inserting at the end, and vice versa.
   - Provide code examples in JavaScript demonstrating both insertion operations and analyze their time complexity.

### Insert Node at End:

1. **Question 1:**
   - Explain the procedure for inserting a node at the end of a singly linked list.
   - Discuss any potential challenges or edge cases that may arise during the insertion process.
   - Provide a real-world scenario where appending nodes to the end of a linked list is commonly used.

2. **Question 2:**
   - Compare the performance implications of inserting a node at the end of a singly linked list versus at the beginning.
   - Discuss how the choice of insertion strategy can impact the overall efficiency of operations performed on the linked list.
   - Provide pseudocode for both insertion scenarios and analyze their time complexity.

### Insert Node at Any Index:

1. **Question 1:**
   - Outline the algorithm for inserting a node at any given index in a singly linked list.
   - Discuss the challenges involved in implementing this operation efficiently, particularly in terms of handling edge cases.
   - Provide an example scenario where inserting a node at a specific index is necessary.

2. **Question 2:**
   - Compare the efficiency of inserting a node at any index in a singly linked list with inserting at the beginning or end.
   - Analyze how the size of the linked list and the target index impact the performance of the insertion operation.
   - Provide a JavaScript code snippet demonstrating the insertion of a node at a specified index and discuss its time complexity.

### Delete Node at Beginning:

1. **Question 1:**
   - Describe the process of deleting a node from the beginning of a singly linked list.
   - Explain how the deletion operation affects the structure of the linked list and the value of its head pointer.
   - Provide a scenario where deleting nodes from the beginning is a crucial operation.

2. **Question 2:**
   - Discuss the time complexity of deleting a node from the beginning of a singly linked list.
   - Compare and contrast the efficiency of deleting from the beginning with deleting from the end or at any index.

### Delete Node at End:

1. **Question 1:**
   - Explain the procedure for deleting a node from the end of a singly linked list.
   - Discuss the challenges or potential errors that may occur if the deletion operation is not properly handled.
   - Provide a real-world example where removing nodes from the end of a linked list is advantageous.

2. **Question 2:**
   - Analyze the time complexity of deleting a node from the end of a singly linked list.
   - Discuss how the efficiency of this operation may be affected by the length of the linked list.
   - Provide a code snippet in JavaScript demonstrating the deletion of a node from the end of a linked list and explain its implementation.
